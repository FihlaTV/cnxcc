1. Overview

   The cnxcc module was created to limit call duration in a multiple-calls/single-client 
   scenario where a single client, identified by a unique value, is making several calls 
   at the same time and consuming its remaining seconds at a rate that is equal to the 
   number of concurrent calls the client is having.
   
   Cnxcc can be used if your AAA software does not mantain the state of the calls 
   it authorizes. For example, consider a call that successfully passed through the 
   authorizer program to the "active" state and two minutes later another call arrived 
   trying to be authorized: our accounting program runs every time a BYE is received
   and since the first call is still online, the credit was not updated while the second
   call arrived and it will be authorized using outdated credit information.
   
   In common cases, both calls will end before the credit is fully exhausted and in 
   this case, no money is lost, but when the credit is about to end but still available, 
   a call can easily consume more credit than it has and in that situation Cnxaaa module
   can help you to authomatically shutdown all calls when the credit reaches zero.
