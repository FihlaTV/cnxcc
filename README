1. Overview
   
   This module was designed to act as a mechanism to limit call duration based on credit information parameters.
   After getting the credit information of the call being set up, you can instruct the module to start monitoring 
   the consumed credit to shutdown a single call or a group of calls in case of credit exhaustion.

   Every call is associated to an unique client/customer identifier. If a credit event occurs, all calls hooked 
   to this identifier are automatically shutdown.

   Cnxcc is dialog-aware so there's no need to explicitly allocate/deallocate the monitoring. Only a single function 
   call inside the script is needed upon reception of the INVITE.

   The credit discount rate is proportional to the number of calls grouped inside an identifier. Once the setup
   of the first call is done, the information remains while the call is active. If the customer starts a new call with
   the same routing criteria, it will land in the same monitoring bag and it will consume the same pool of credit in
   rates that are equal to the cost per second of both calls.

   If your accounting program does not maintain the state of the call in real time, this module can provide you
   with that ability.

2. Dependencies

   The following module must be loaded before this module:
   * dialog

3. Parameters

3.1. dlg_flag (integer)
   
   Flag to indicate if the dialog must be monitored or not. Messages are flagged with this value if we call one of
   the monitoring functions.

   Example:
   ...
   modparam("cnxcc", "dlg_flag", 29)
   ...

3.2. credit_check_period (integer)

   Indicates how often the credit checking function should be called. It is directly related to the precison of the 
   module. The maximum precision is 1, which means that every call is checked every one second. 

   Values greater than 1 leads to precision lost but less CPU consumption.

   Example:
   ...
   modparam("cnxcc", "credit_check_period", 1)
   ...

3.3. number_of_timers (integer)

   How many timer processes the module will set up to perform the monitoring tasks. The value must be an even number. In
   case it is not, it will be automatically rounded.

   Example:
   ...
   modparam("cnxcc", "number_of_timers", 4)
   ...

4. Functions

4.1. cnxcc_set_max_time()

  Specifies a specific amount of time the call should last at most.

  Example:
  ...
  $var(customer) = "john-doe-123-premium";
  $var(max_time) = 120;
  cnxcc_set_max_time("$var(customer)", "$var(max_time)");
  ...

   To use the module, run kamailio with the supplied configuration file, register two
   softphones that will call each other and watch the log files to see how the calls are
   automatically shutdown when the credit is exhausted.

   Example:

   route[CNXCC]
   {
      $var(client)		= "test-client-0-123-01";
      $var(credit) 		= "50";
      $var(cost_per_sec) 	= "0.5";
      $var(i_pulse)		= "30";
      $var(f_pulse)		= "6";
      
      if (!cnxcc_set_max_credit("$var(client)",
      			  "$var(credit)", 
      			  "$var(cost_per_sec)", 
      			  "$var(i_pulse)", 
      			  "$var(f_pulse)")) {
   	   xlog("Error setting up credit control");
	   }
   }

   This module has also a web interface which makes the visualization nicer.
